# Security Notis!

Currently this should be considered a prof of concept, at this point in time anyone with the right url can access this terminal when you have started it. A simple security meassure could be to simply change the url to include a long random string, as long as no one else know the url they can't access the terminal.

Relying on a random url is not a good setup though, it would be much better to setup something like basic auth instead. It should be fairly simply to add to this app, I have just not gotten it to work yet. Pull requests are welcomed!
