# Security Notis!

Currently this should be considered a prof of concept, at this point in time anyone with the right url can access this terminal when you have started it. A simple security meassure could be to simple change the url to include a long random string, as long as no one else know the url then can't access the terminal.

This is not a very secure setup though, it should be fairly simply to add basic auth to this app, I have just not gotten it to work yet. Pull requests are welcomed!
